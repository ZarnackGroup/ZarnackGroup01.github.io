# Learning the Molecular Code of RNA Regulation

RNA regulation plays a major role in cellular function, and alterations such as alternative splicing are frequently implicated in human disease including cancer. Key players are RBPs that recognise cis-regulatory RNA sequence elements, such as short sequence motifs or structured RNA folds. However, the position and function of most cis-regulatory elements remain unknown, hindering the interpretation of disease-associated mutations and the resulting splicing changes.

We recently established a high-throughput screening approach to decode the cis-regulatory landscape of alternative splicing decisions in collaboration with Dr. Julian König and Dr. Stefan Legewie at IMB in Mainz. As a prototype example, we dissected the cancer-relevant alternative exon 11 in the proto-oncogene MST1R (RON) encoding for a receptor tyrosine kinase ([Braun et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05748-7)). Skipping of RON exon 11 results in the pathological isoform RON∆165 that promotes tumour invasiveness and is frequently upregulated in tumours. Mathematical modeling of splicing kinetics in the Legewie group enabled us to identify more than 1,000 mutations affecting RON exon 11 skipping. Importantly, the measured effects correlated with RON alternative splicing in cancer patients bearing the same mutations. Moreover, we highlighted the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH) as a key regulator of RON splicing in healthy tissues and cancer. Our results offer insights into splicing regulation and the hidden layer of splicing-effective mutations in cancer.

Mutagenic PCR creates mutated minigene library (left) that gives rise to alternatively spliced transcripts (middle). Mutations and corresponding splicing products are characterised by DNA and RNA sequencing, respectively, and linked by unique 15-nt barcode sequence in each minigene (coloured boxes). Black and grey boxes depict constitutive and alternative exons, respectively.

Each mutation effect is indicated as a coloured dot according to the inserted nucleobase (see legend). Red lines indicate median (dashed) ± 2 standard deviations (SD; solid) for unmutated wild-type (wt) minigenes.

In collaboration with JunProf. Müller-McNicoll at GU Frankfurt, we investigate how SR proteins connect pre-mRNA splicing with alternative polyadenylation and nuclear export of specific mRNA isoforms. In this project within the DFG Collaborative Research Consortium SFB902 “Molecular Principles of RNA-based Regulation”, we discovered that SRSF3 and SRSF7 regulate alternative polyadenlyation in opposing directions, thereby changing the mRNA’s fate from export and translation in the cytoplasm to retention in the nucleus (Müller-McNicoll et al., 2016). In a parallel line of research, we reported that SRSF5 effects an export switch of its target mRNAs during neuronal differentiation through a reversible inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (Botti et al., 2017).

Intracellular mRNA transport and local translation are evolutionarily conserved concepts that play essential roles in cellular compartmentalisation from yeast to human. In collaboration with several groups of the DFG Research Unit FOR2333 “Macromolecular complexes in mRNA localization", we employ our expertise on protein-RNA interactions to study the molecular determinants of RBP binding in mRNA translocation. By studying similar processes in different model organisms, we decipher the global rules of zipcode recognition and pinpoint analogies as well as differences across evolution. For instance, we recently described how the RNA-binding protein Rrm4 recognises its target mRNAs in infectious hyphae of the corn pathogen Ustilago maydis (Olgeiser et al, 2019). In budding yeast, we further study the specific targeting of mRNAs that enables a spatio-temporal protein expression in the bud tip. The most prominent example is the targeted ASH1 mRNA whose protein product regulates mating-type switching in the daughter cells. Recognition by the mRNA transport machinery requires zipcodes that are encoded in the secondary structure of the RNA molecules.
